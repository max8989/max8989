## About Me

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on automation, performance, and system-level control.  
I run my workflow and services on **custom-built Linux servers** and maintain a minimal, fast, and open-source tech stack.

##  My Setup

- **Arch Linux/Hyprland** (daily driver)
-  Self-hosted infrastructure (NGINX Proxy Manager, Supabase, Prometheus, Nextcloud, Home Assistant, Portainer, Vaultwarden, Docker, NAS)
-  Local and cloud-based backups
