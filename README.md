## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on automation, performance, and system-level control.  
I run my workflow and services on **custom-built Linux servers** and maintain a minimal, fast, and open-source tech stack.

🧩 I value:
- Simplicity through automation
- Privacy and control via self-hosting
- Performance-first coding
- Learning by doing — and often breaking things along the way

## 🐧 My Setup

- 🖥 **Arch Linux/Hyprland** (daily driver)
- 🔒 Self-hosted infrastructure (NGINX Proxy Manager, Supabase, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker)
- 💾 Local and cloud-based backups
- 🛠 Favorite tools: Zed, Neovim, Git, SSH, Tmux, systemd

## 🔭 Current Interests

- Building and refining my **Linux workstation and dotfiles**
- Hosting personal services on my own hardware and cloud
- Customizing and optimizing my **home server setup**
- Deploying and scaling services from home lab to cloud
- Exploring AI-assisted workflows, GitHub automation, and MCP servers
