## 🧠 About Me

I'm a software developer with a strong focus on automation, performance, and system-level control.  
I run my workflow and services on **custom-built Linux servers** and maintain a minimal, fast, and open-source tech stack.

🧩 I value:
- Simplicity through automation
- Privacy and control via self-hosting
- Performance-first coding
- Learning by doing — and often breaking things along the way

## 🐧 My Setup

- 🖥 **Arch Linux/Hyprland** (daily driver)
- 🔒 Self-hosted infrastructure (NGINX Proxy Manager, Supabase, Prometheus, Nextcloud, Home Assistant, Portainer, Vaultwarden, Docker, NAS)
- 💾 Local and cloud-based backups
